## Introduction
This project, **SpicyBox**, is a simple yet addictive game created with the Godot game engine. It serves as my first foray into game development, marking a starting point for my exploration of Godot's capabilities.

### The Goal
In **SpicyBox**, you take control of a brave pixel character on a mission to collect all the Coins in the shortest time! However, it's a quirky adventure with unexpected twists and challenges. Be prepared for frustration, fun, and a sprinkle of spice!

### Gameplay Mechanics
- **Movement:** Use the arrow keys (with space to jump) to navigate your character.
- **Coin Collection:** Collect all the coins to complete a stage.
- **Obstacles:** Be wary of pits scattered throughout the level. Falling into one means game over!
- **Monsters:** Be careful! Touching a monster also results in a game over.

### Visuals
**SpicyBox** embraces a charming pixel art aesthetic, evoking a sense of nostalgia for classic arcade games.

## Learning Experience
Developing **SpicyBox** was an invaluable learning experience. It allowed me to:
- **Grasp the fundamentals of Godot:** I familiarized myself with the Godot interface, scripting mechanics, and asset management.
- **Experiment with game design:** **SpicyBox** served as a platform to explore core game design principles like level creation, character movement, and scoring systems.

## Looking Ahead
This initial project has laid the foundation for further exploration of game development. I'm excited to build upon the knowledge gained while creating **SpicyBox** and embark on more ambitious projects within the Godot game engine.

### Let the pixelated adventure begin!
